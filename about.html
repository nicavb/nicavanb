                                    These experiences have helped me gain many essential skills. I am an effective teacher and am bilingual. I have worked remoteley and am apdept at using platforms such as zoom, google meet and more. Managing a fireworks tent taught me valuable customer service and retail skills as well as inventory management and organization.
